# Portfolio

Deployed site: https://elegant-easley-7c5f61.netlify.app/

Need to fix responsiveness, update project pictures and full accessability with aria labels.

Struggled with layout as I did not have a clear picture of how to build the site from the start.

Did start building project objects in js as we had discussed with a collegue that it was like the cluedo project and would be easier to update the portfolio.
Abandonned the idea to focus on the html and csss.

I struggle with time management and structure.
Work in progress.
